/** 
 * fs provides functionalities required to work with file systems
 * 
 * All file system operations have synchronous and asynchronous forms.
 * 
 * The asynchronous form always takes a completion callback as its last argument. The arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the first argument is always reserved for an exception. If the operation was completed successfully, then the first argument will be null or undefined.
 * 
 * Exceptions that occur using synchronous operations are thrown immediately and may be handled using tryâ€¦catch, or may be allowed to bubble up.
 * 
 * In busy processes, use the asynchronous versions of these calls. The synchronous versions will block the entire process until they complete, halting all connections.

/**
 * File Descriptors:
 * 
 * for every process, the kernel maintains a table of currently open files and resources. Each open file is assigned a simple numeric identifier called a file descriptor. At the system-level, all file system operations use these file descriptors to identify and track each specific file. 
 * 
 * The fs.open() method is used to allocate a new file descriptor. Once allocated, the file descriptor may be used to read data from, write data to, or request information about the file.
 * 
 * Most operating systems limit the number of file descriptors that may be open at any given time so it is critical to close the descriptor when operations are completed. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak that will eventually cause an application to crash.
